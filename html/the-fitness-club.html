            <p>Had a great workout this afternoon. Equipment is spaced apart and clean. Wipes, paper towels, antibacterial spray are located in each area for use. There is a wide selection of of machines and staff. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Rooms are spacious and temperature is kept cool.</p>

            <p>I signed up to this gym a few years ago with one goal of making exercise part of my life. Since then I attended twice a week with one of the personal trainers (Greg Small), he is amazingly easy to work with, really motivating whilst pushing you to improve. I find this gym has all the equipment I need is easy to access and clean. I would highly recommend. </p>

            <p>I have been using this gym for 3 years and alway enjoy coming. The staff are lovely and helpful. It's a very inclusive gym, you're made to feel welcome and there's always someone to ask for help. There is no competitiveness during the classes or using the gym equipment. It's a really great place to train. If you're thinking about joining, I would highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>I am a member at The Fitness Club, and have been for almost a year, and I still love it. So glad I changed gyms to The Fitness Club, the best thing I've ever done. The classes and equipment are all good! Plus it helps that majority of the personal trainers are friendly and helpful.</p>
